🧬 Cancer Prediction Using Python
A machine learning project for predicting cancer using Python and scikit-learn. This project aims to provide an accurate and efficient solution to assist in early cancer detection using supervised learning algorithms on medical datasets.

🔍 Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on key medical features. Using publicly available datasets (e.g., Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset), the model is trained, evaluated, and deployed for inference.

🚀 Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature selection and scaling

Model training with various classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)

Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.

Interactive prediction script using user input

Jupyter Notebook for visualization and interpretability

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📁 Dataset
This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
